# readme

Create a bash script that generates a `README.md` for the root of this repo.

Requirements:

* Concatenate the `README.md`s from the subdirectories.
* Convert `h1`s to `h2`s, `h2`s to `h3`s, and so on.
* Include an intro and table of contents.
* Script should be a one-liner with no subshells.
* Overuse regex and make the script fragile af.
